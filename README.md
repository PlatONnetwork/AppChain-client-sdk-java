1. SDK includes PlatON network already. User can initialize custom networks, the latest is the current network.
```java
NetworkParameters.init(2000L, "ABC");  
```

chain ID 201018 is reserved for Alaya, and chain ID 210425 is reserved for PlatON.

2. user can switch current network if multi-networks have been initialized.
```java
NetworkParameters.selectNetwork(2000L, "ABC");  
```
3. In Alaya, the gas price for submitting a proposal is lower than in PlatON. When initializing a network with the parameter chainIdï¼š201018 or hrp:atp, this network will be considered as an Alaya network.
